# todo: make runtime model conformance test based on regular tictactoe
#   first understand how it generates tests and what they signify
#       it should generate tests based on expectations, handling non-determinism
#   analyse efficacy by seeing what it makes sure of based on the tests
#   prove all cases that it missed (if any), and use that in results and discussion
# then, use it to verify the updated versions based on selected features
# mutation analysis? look at paper (which is deemed satisfactory)
